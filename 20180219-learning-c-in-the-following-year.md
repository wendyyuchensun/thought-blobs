# Learn C in the Following Year

## The Why

I've been wanting to learn C for a long time, but never have the chance to really
dig into it deeply. Why learn C? As this [blog post][1] suggested, C is at the
bottom of almost everything's stack, and I do have strong interests in getting down
to nitty-gritty.

I think the reason why I did not begin earlier is because I also wanted to learn a 
lot of things other than C at the same time, such as JavaScript, Ruby & RoR.  It
turns out that after monthes of trying, this expectation has gradually turned into 
illusion. Studying multiple things at the same time does not yield much I can
call 'productive'. To make things worse, it brings me distraction.  I realized that
I can never master something without paying full attention into it.

Why try so hard to reach a balance that doesn't exist?

So I thought to myself, if I need to choose between JavaScript, Ruby and C right now,
which one will I choose? The answer is surprisingly not the beginning two, though
they are much more close to my day to day work. It's C. Why again? Well, it's not 
JavaScript and Ruby are not interesting to me, but C is of my top priority. I
don't want to sacrifice my passion to learn just for work. "Work is transient, but
interest lasts lifelong". Call me naive if you want. 

## The Lists

## Other Decisions

Apart learning C, I also made up my mind to:

1. "Reason" about what I have learned through blog posts and oral presentation.
2. Stop wasting time on things I don't want to do, or at least only spend least
   amount of time on them (like only write a blog post in 30 minutes).
3. Stop feeling inferior for not knowing nothing. Believe that it happens quiet
   often to everyone.
