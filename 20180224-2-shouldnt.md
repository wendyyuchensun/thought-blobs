## You Shouldn't Sell Things You Don't Know How to Produce

This is a common mistake. Most people think selling and producing can be seperated,
but I disagree. The art to successfully sell something lies in knowing what you
sell well, and that's the way to make realistic, even accurate or creative judgements
regarding the whole producing and selling process.

## You Shouldn't Design Something That Contains Uncertainty

Or else you are just throwing stones at your foot. You will need to implement too
much calculation to determin the situation. That doesn't count the time you need
to maintain your calcalation system, and the cognitive loading everytime you refamiliar
with it.

Uncertainty should be ommitted during the design proccess.
